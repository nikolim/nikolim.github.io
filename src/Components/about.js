      Hi, I am Nikolai and I am enthusiastic about technology. My passion is
      to design, program and create. I am currently doing my master in
      Computer Science at KTH in Stockholm and have bachelor in Computer
      Science as well as Mechanical Engineering. I am working as a Software
      Engineer in a R&D company, focusing on AI, IOT and driver assistance
      systems. In my free time I enjoy to experiment with different
      programming languages and explore new technologies.
